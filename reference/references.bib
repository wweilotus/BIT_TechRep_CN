abstract = {[G2 cont trajectories - curvature is a polynomial function of arc$\backslash$nlength]$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe trajectory generation problem for mobile robots consists in providing$\backslash$na set of trajectories that are "smooth" and meet certain boundary$\backslash$nconditions. We present a method to generate curvature continuous$\backslash$ntrajectories for which the curvature profile is a polynomial function$\backslash$nof arc length. An algorithm based on the deformation of a curve by$\backslash$nenegy minimization allows to solve general geometric constraints$\backslash$nwhich was not possible by previous methods. Furthermore, we are able$\backslash$nto make into account the limitation of radius of curvature of the$\backslash$nrobot by controlling the extrema of curvature along the path.},

abstract = {We present a primal-dual interior-point algorithm with a filter line-search method for nonlinear programming. Local and global convergence properties of this method were analyzed in previous work. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, including the feasibility restoration phase for the filter method, second-order corrections, and inertia correction of the KKT matrix. Heuristics are also considered that allow faster performance. This method has been implemented in the IPOPT code, which we demonstrate in a detailed numerical study based on 954 problems from the CUTEr test set. An evaluation is made of several line-search options, and a comparison is provided with two state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlinear programming.},
